A database of all 807 Pok√©mons along with their sprites

The database in available only in JSON format, and the Schema looks like this for Mew:

    {
		"number": "151",
		"name": "Mew",
		"species": "New Species",
		"types": [
			"Psychic"
		],
		"abilities": {
			"normal": [
			  "Synchronize"
			],
			"hidden": []
			},
		"eggGroups": [
			"Undiscovered"
		],
		"gender": [],
		"height": "1'04\"",
		"weight": "8.8 lbs.",
		"family": {
		"id": 78,
		"evolutionStage": 1,
		"evolutionLine": [
			"Mew"
		]
		},
		"starter": false,
		"legendary": false,
		"mythical": true,
		"ultraBeast": false,
		"mega": false,
		"gen": 1
    }

Pretty self-explanatory.
    
Of course, all of this data is the property of Game Freaks / Nintendo / Whatever / Please don't sue me I don't have money / bla bla bla, and were shamelessly scrapped from sevral public APIs.
